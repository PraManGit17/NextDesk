PROJECTS
Urban Chemical Dispersion Modeling using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Predicted precise concentration of chemical tracer across a compact urban region using PINNs
-Developed a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to model the dispersion of hazardous chemical 
tracers in urban environments, solving the Convection-Diffusion Equation. 
-Engineered the model with 6 dense layers, experimenting with activation functions like Tanh, GELU, and 
Swish to optimize convergence and stability.
-Conducted hyperparameter tuning, including training over 5000 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001, and 
transitioned from Adam to L-BFGS optimizer for improved optimization performance. 
-Utilized Glorot initialization for weight distribution, ensuring faster convergence and reduced training time. 
-Achieved an L2 error score of 0.45, demonstrating good model accuracy.
MLLM Shakti–Multimodal Image Conversational Military Chatbot
Developed a conversational AI chatbot for BEL capable of processing videos, images and text.
-Integrated OWL and QWEN-2 models to process text and image inputs. 
-Implemented advanced attention mechanisms and optimized IPRM and ROPE for enhanced model 
accuracy. 
-Curated and preprocessed a custom image dataset, ensuring diversity and alignment with project-specific 
require- ments.
•Credit Card Behaviour Score Prediction
Developed a predictive model to assess credit card default probabilities, enabling robust portfolio risk 
management.
-Implemented advanced tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, TabNet) and 
neural networks, achieving 97% accuracy on validation data. -Conducted extensive exploratory data 
analysis and data cleaning, identifying critical insights and addressing miss- ing values and outliers.
-Evaluated models using advanced metrics for imbalanced datasets, including G-Mean, MCC, Cohen’s 
Kappa, and weighted F1 scores, prioritizing false negative penalization.
